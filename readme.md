# TypeScript Concepts for Backend Development

This guide provides an in-depth exploration of key TypeScript concepts essential for backend developers, complete with examples, detailed explanations, and practical use cases. Use this as a reference for yourself and to train your team.

## **1. Type Annotations**

TypeScript allows developers to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This ensures type safety and helps catch errors early during development.

### Example:

```typescript
let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add(5, 10); // 15
```

### Detailed Explanation:

- `message: string` ensures that `message` can only contain string values. Attempting to assign another type will trigger a compile-time error.
- `add(a: number, b: number): number` enforces that the arguments and return value are numbers, ensuring consistency and preventing unexpected behavior.

**Real-world Use Case:** Enforcing strict types in API request handlers ensures that incoming and outgoing data adhere to expected formats, reducing bugs in production systems.

---

## **2. Interfaces**

Interfaces define the structure of an object. They ensure consistency by requiring objects to conform to a specific shape.

### Example:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function getUserInfo(user: User): string {
  return `User: ${user.name}, Email: ${user.email}`;
}

const user: User = { id: 1, name: "John", email: "john@example.com" };
console.log(getUserInfo(user));
```

### Detailed Explanation:

- The `User` interface specifies that any object of this type must have `id`, `name`, and `email` properties, each with specific types.
- Passing an object that does not conform to the interface structure will result in a TypeScript error.

**Real-world Use Case:** Interfaces are widely used to define the structure of database models or to validate API request payloads.

---

## **3. Generics**

Generics provide a way to create reusable and flexible components while maintaining type safety.

### Example:

```typescript
function getFirstElement<T>(items: T[]): T {
  return items[0];
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const strings = ["a", "b", "c"];

console.log(getFirstElement(numbers)); // 1
console.log(getFirstElement(strings)); // "a"
```

### Detailed Explanation:

- `<T>` represents a placeholder type that is specified when the function is called.
- This allows `getFirstElement` to work with arrays of any type while preserving the type information.

**Real-world Use Case:** Use generics in repository patterns to handle CRUD operations for various database entities with type safety.

---

## **4. Classes and Constructors**

Classes encapsulate data and behavior into a single structure. Constructors are used to initialize object properties when creating instances of a class.

### Example:

```typescript
class Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;

  constructor(name: string, price: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }

  getDetails(): string {
    return `${this.name} costs $${this.price}`;
  }
}

const product = new Product("Laptop", 1200);
console.log(product.getDetails());
```

### Detailed Explanation:

- The `constructor` initializes the `name` and `price` properties when creating an instance of `Product`.
- Methods like `getDetails` define the behavior associated with the class.

**Real-world Use Case:** Define service classes for handling business logic or models that represent database entities.

---

## **5. Access Modifiers**

Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`) control the visibility and accessibility of class members.

### Example:

```typescript
class User {
  private password: string;

  constructor(password: string) {
    this.password = password;
  }

  public getPassword(): string {
    return this.password;
  }
}

const user = new User("securePassword123");
console.log(user.getPassword()); // "securePassword123"
```

### Detailed Explanation:

- `private` restricts access to within the class only.
- `public` makes methods or properties accessible from anywhere.

**Real-world Use Case:** Use access modifiers to encapsulate sensitive data like passwords or tokens and expose them only through secure methods.

---

## **6. Decorators**

Decorators are special functions that can modify classes, methods, or properties. They are extensively used in frameworks like NestJS for dependency injection and middleware.

### Example:

```typescript
function LogMethod(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;

  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Method ${propertyKey} called with arguments:`, args);
    return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
  };
}

class Calculator {
  @LogMethod
  add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
calc.add(5, 10); // Logs: "Method add called with arguments: [5, 10]"
```

### Detailed Explanation:

- `@LogMethod` is a method decorator that intercepts method calls to add logging functionality.
- Decorators can be applied to classes, properties, methods, and parameters to implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, validation, or authentication.

**Real-world Use Case:** Use decorators in controllers to handle validation or middleware in frameworks like NestJS.

---

## **7. Dependency Injection (DI)**

Dependency Injection is a design pattern where dependencies are provided externally rather than being instantiated within a class. This enhances modularity and testability.

### Example:

```typescript
class DatabaseService {
  connect() {
    console.log("Connected to database.");
  }
}

class UserService {
  constructor(private dbService: DatabaseService) {}

  getUserData() {
    this.dbService.connect();
    console.log("Fetching user data...");
  }
}

const dbService = new DatabaseService();
const userService = new UserService(dbService);
userService.getUserData();
```

### Detailed Explanation:

- Instead of creating a `DatabaseService` instance inside `UserService`, it is injected through the constructor.
- This separation of concerns makes it easier to test `UserService` by injecting mocked dependencies.

**Real-world Use Case:** Manage services like database connections or logging in scalable backend systems using dependency injection frameworks like InversifyJS or the built-in DI system in NestJS.
